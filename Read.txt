It was first released on October 2, 2006.

Google Guava is an open-source set of common libraries for Java, mainly developed by Google engineers.
Google Guava can be roughly divided into three components:
- Google Collections Library [ an extension to the Java collections framework (JCF)]
- 


Maven:
Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Oracle Coherence:
A java based in-memory data grid designed to have better reliability, scalability and performance than traditional relational database management systems. 
Originally developed by Tangosol Inc.

XPATH:

XPath = use of a path notation for navigating through the hierarchical structure of an XML document.
XPath 3.1 is a case-sensitive language.
DefinitionS: 
	In the data model, a value is always a sequence.
	A sequence is an ordered collection of zero or more items.
	An item is either an atomic value, a node, or a function.
	An atomic value is a value in the value space of an atomic type, as defined in [XML Schema 1.0] or [XML Schema 1.1].
	There are seven kinds of Nodes in the data model: document, element, attribute, text, namespace, processing instruction, and comment.
	A node is an instance of one of the node kinds. Each node has a unique node identity, a typed value, and a string value. In addition, some nodes have a name. The typed value of a node is a sequence of zero or more atomic values. The string value of a node is a value of type xs:string. The name of a node is a value of type xs:QName.

	A sequence containing exactly one item is called a singleton.
	An item is identical to a singleton sequence containing that item. Sequences are never nestedâ€”for example, combining the values 1, (2, 3), and ( ) into a single sequence results in the sequence (1, 2, 3). 
	A sequence containing zero items is called an empty sequence.

	The term XDM instance is used, synonymously with the term value, to denote an unconstrained sequence of items.
