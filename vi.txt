Running UNIX shell commands from vi
-----------------------------------

You can run UNIX commands and see their output without leaving vi. You can also insert the output of a UNIX command into the file you that are editing.

To run a single UNIX command use the command:
   :!UNIX_command

You can start a shell from within vi and use it as you would your usual UNIX environment, then exit the shell and return to vi

To start up a shell enter the command:
   :sh
The type of shell that is started is determined by the $SHELL variable. You can specify that some other shell is to be started by setting the vi shell option

Return to using vi by entering the command exit or Ctrl-D

To insert the output from a UNIX command into a file, immediately after the cursor:
   :r!command
For example, this facility would be very useful if you were using vi to document a UNIX command and you wanted to include examples of the output from this command.

To comment multiple lines:
<ESC> + Move cursor to the line set for the beginning of the comment
<NO>!!awk '{print "\#",$0}'
Here, <NO> = no of lines to be commented out

To comment out all lines in a file:
<:>%s/^/#/g

Exit from insert mode in ex:
Enter a line containing a simple dot . or hit CTRL-c
NOTE: :insert will keep asking for lines until you type a line only containing '.'. For more help see :h :i

To delete range of lines:

--------------------------------------------------
vi from outside:

To delete range of lines:
vi + <start_ln>,<end_ln> + wq <file_name>
