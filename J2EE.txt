J2EE is essentially about standardizing a range of enterprise services, such as naming and directory services
(JNDI), transaction management offering a standard API potentially spanning disparate transactional
resources (JTS and JTA), connection to legacy systems (JCA), resource pooling, and thread
management. The true power of J2EE lies in these services, and this standardization has done great
service to the industry.
