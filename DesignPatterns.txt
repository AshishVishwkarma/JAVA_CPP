Usage of design patterns in the java library:
Decorator:
---------
The design of the stream classes in the java.io package makes it possible for them to be combined using the decorator design-pattern. When a stream is closed, it also closes the stream that it is decorating.
Example:
	private void incorrectWriting() throws IOException {
       DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data"));
       out.writeInt(666);
       out.writeUTF("Hello");
       out.close();
   }
